The first to fourth columns represent, in order: RL, minimum theory value, central theory value, and maximum theory value. The three theory values provide the uncertainties from scale variation. Please note that no normalization has been applied. You should
 normalize the central curve as we discussed and use the same normalization factor for the minimum and maximum curves.
